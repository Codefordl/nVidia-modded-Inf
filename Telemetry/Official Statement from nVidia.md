> Hi all, wanted to reply to this thread with some information:

> We have made updates to help users worldwide manage their privacy and data.

> The only way NVIDIA will collect your personal data when you install the latest 397.93 GeForce driver package (https://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/134624) is if you specifically choose to install GeForce Experience and give us permission to collect data.

> If you install the driver package and don’t want personal data collected, select “NVIDIA Graphics driver” only from the installer menu.

> We promise to protect your privacy and your data. Our NVIDIA Privacy Policy (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-policy/) explains what data we collect and what we do with it.

> NVIDIA does not share any personally identifiable information collected by GeForce Experience outside the company. NVIDIA may share aggregate-level data with select partners, but does not share user-level data… Aggregate data refers to information about a group of users rather than an individual. For example, there are now 80 million users of GeForce Experience.
